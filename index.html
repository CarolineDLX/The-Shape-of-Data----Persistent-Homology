    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This script was developed as part of an undergraduate project (WXML - Washington eExperimental
      Mathematics Lab) at University of Washington in Autumn 2022. The project entitled “Analyzing the
      'Shape' of Data - Persistent Homology” was mentored by Dr. Zhixu Su and PhD candidate Chengyuan Ma.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Topological data analysis uses techniques from topology to understand the ‘shape’ of
      data set, which can be high dimensional and noisy. Given a point cloud data set, one
      can construct a nested sequence of complexes thickening the data set at different scales.
      Persistent homology detects topological features of the complexes that persist over a
      range of scales, it computes the numbers of connected components, 1-dimensional holes (loops),
      2-dimensional holes (voids), etc, and keeps track of the birth and death scale of the features.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In this project, we learned various methods of building filtered simplicial complexes and understood
      the standard algorithm for computing persistent homology. We wrote Python code to construct and plot
      Lazy Witness Complexes generated from a 3D point cloud data. In particular, we experimented with 3D data
      points synthesized from the implicit equation of a genus 5 surface.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Lazy Witness Complex</h2>
    <p>
      Given a finite set of point \(S\) in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) with the landmark subset \(L\). <br>
      At each filtration value \(t\), two landmarks \(\ell_i\) and \(\ell_j\) are connected by 1-simplex
      if there exists a witness point \(w\) such that:
      $$\max \{ d(\ell_i, w), d(\ell_j, w) \} \leq t + \nu(w)$$
      Where \(\nu(w)\) is the \(\nu\)th distance between \(w\) and its nearest landmark point (\(\nu = 0, 1, 2\)). Three landmarks are connected
      by 2-simplex if every pair has been connected.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Algorithms</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Get the data set</h3>
    <p>
      Generating a certain number of data points from a genus 5 surface equation.
    </p>
      
     <h4> Genus 5 surface equation </h4>
     \( 3 + 8(x^4 + y^4 + z^4) = 8(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) \)
    
    <h3>Step 2: Choosing landmarks</h3>
    <p>
      If we have a huge data set, generating smaller number of simplices could speed up the construction
      of filtered simplicial complexes. Therefore, we can choose a subset of data points, called land-marks,
      that can still capture the shape of the original data set by applying the <strong>Sequential MaxMin Method</strong>.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Sequential MaxMin Method</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Randomly select the first landmark among the data points.</li>
      <li>Select the second landmark which is the farthest data point from the first landmark.</li>
      <li>Select the third landmark which has the largest minimum distance of the first two landmarks.etc.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      Here is an output of four selected landmarks from 9 data points using Sequential MaxMin Method:

    <p>
      This figure shows the sequence of selecting the landmarks, starting from the red point.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Step 3: Calculate \(\nu(w)\)</h3>
    <p>
      Finding the distance of the \(\nu\)th closest landmark for each point in the data set.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Step 4: Draw lazy witness complexes</h3>
    <p>
      Forming 1-simplex and 2-simplex by connecting the points and edges that satisfied the lazy witness complex criteria.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Output: Genus 5 Surface</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We used Python to draw the genus 5 surface by applying the lazy witness complex.</li>
      <li>Below is the result of running the Python code.</li>
      <li>This graph shows that using the Lazy Witness Complex to analyze the 'shape' of the genus 5 surface equation
        could give us the genus 5 surface successfully.
    </ul>
