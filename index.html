    <h2>The 'Shape' of a Data Set</h2>
    
    <p style="width: 80%;">
      We used techniques from topology to understand the 'shape' of data set. Persistent homology detects topological
      features of the complexes that persist over a range of scales, it computes the numbers of connected components,
      1-dimensional holes (loops), 2-dimensional holes (voids), etc, and keeps track of the birth and death scale of
      the features. <br>
      
      In this project, we plot the <strong>genus 5 surface</strong> by applying the <strong>lazy witness complex</strong>.

    <h3>Lazy Witness Complex</h3>
    
    <p>
      Given a finite set of point $S$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with the landmark subset $L$.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Result of the Lazy Witness Complex</h4>
    
    <p>
      This is the 3D genus 5 surface graph. It has has 1 0-dimensional hole, 10 1-dimensional holes, 1 2-dimensional hole.
