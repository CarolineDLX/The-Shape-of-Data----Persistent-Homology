    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Topological data analysis uses techniques from topology to understand the ‘shape’ of
      data set, which can be high dimensional and noisy. Given a point cloud data set, one
      can construct a nested sequence of complexes thickening the data set at different scales.
      Persistent homology detects topological features of the complexes that persist over a
      range of scales, it computes the numbers of connected components, 1-dimensional holes (loops),
      2-dimensional holes (voids), etc, and keeps track of the birth and death scale of the features.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this project, we applied the <strong>Lazy Witness Complex</strong> to compute the persistent homology
      of synthetic data.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Lazy Witness Complex</h2>
    <p>
      Given a finite set of point \(S\) in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) with the landmark subset \(L\). <br>
      At each filtration value \(t\), two landmarks \(\ell_i\) and \(\ell_j\) are connected by 1-simplex
      if there exists a witness point \(w\) such that:
      $$\max \{ d(\ell_i, w), d(\ell_j, w) \} \leq t + \nu(w)$$
      Where \(\nu(w)\) is the distance between \(w\) and its nearest landmark point. Three landmarks are connected
      by 2-simplex if every pair has been connected.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Algorithms</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Get the data set</h3>
    Generating a certain number of data points from the implicit surface equation.
    
    <h3>Step 2: Choosing landmarks</h3>
    <p>
      If we have a huge data set, generating smaller number of simplices could speed up the construction
      of filtered simplicial complexes. Therefore, we can choose a subset of data points, called land-marks,
      that can still capture the shape of the original data set by applying the <strong>Sequential MaxMin Method</strong>.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Sequential MaxMin</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Randomly select the first landmark among the data points.</li>
      <li>Select the second landmark which is the farthest data point from the first landmark.</li>
      <li>Select the third landmark which has the largest minimum distance of the first two landmarks.etc.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      Here is an output using a simple data set:

    <p>
      This figure shows the sequence of selecting the landmarks, starting from the red point.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Step 3: Calculate \(\nu(w)\)</h3>
    <p>
      Finding the closest landmark for each point in the data set.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Step 4: Draw lazy witness complexes</h3>
    <p>
      Forming 1-simplex and 2-simplex by connecting the points that satisfied the lazy witness complex criteria.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Output: Genus 5 Surface</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We used Python to draw the genus 5 surface by applying the lazy witness complex.</li>
      <li>Below is the result of running the Python code.</li>
