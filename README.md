This is a project from UW WXML Autumn 2022. We used techniques from topology to understand the 'shape' of data set. Persistent homology detects topological features of the complexes that persist over a range of scales, it computes the numbers of connected components, 1-dimensional holes (loops), 2-dimensional holes (voids), etc, and keeps track of the birth and death scale of the features.
